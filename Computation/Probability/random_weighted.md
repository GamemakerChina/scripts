===============

This function randomly selects an index based on its probability 
relative to the probabilities of other given indices. For instance,
if the supplied probabilities are 1, 2, and 3, the first index will
be returned 1/6 of the time, the second index will be returned 1/3
of the time, and the third index will be returned 1/2 of the time.
